        Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data
        Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"),
        "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as
        collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation,
        alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
        dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination,
        restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether
        by automated means or not.

      <p>
        The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular
        about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the
        processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction
        with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components
        we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may
        result in said third parties also processing data they collect and
        control.

        <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
        <p>
          With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail
          below, users and data subjects have the right
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
            information about the data being processed, further information
            about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf.
            also Art. 15 GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>
            to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art.
            16 GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>
            to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17
            DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as
            stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per
            Art. 18 GDPR;
          </li>
          <li>
            to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
            them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers
            (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>
            to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
            that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
            breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to
          whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or
          restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18
          GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is
          impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users
          have a right to information about these recipients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right
            to object to the controller's future processing of their data
            pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection
            to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is
            permissible.

        <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
        <p>
          Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked
          as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the
          deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
          obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
        </p>

        <h4>Contact</h4>
        <p>
          If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide
          will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have
          this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we
          will not be able to answer it in full or at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b)
          GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and
          there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an
          order or contract resulted therefrom.
        </p>

        <h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
        <p>
          We also integrate the following social media sites into our website.
          The integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective
          site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents the
          automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their
          display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be
          forwarded to the service of the respective social network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you click, that network may record information about you and your
          visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will be
          processed in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date
          and time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged into
          your user account on that network, however, the network operator might
          assign the information collected about your visit to our site to your
          personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this
          information can be stored your personal user account and possibly
          posted on the respective network. To prevent this, you need to log out
          of your social media account before clicking on the graphic. The
          various social media networks also offer settings that you can
          configure accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following social networks are integrated into our site by linked
          graphics:

        <h4>Google Analytics</h4>
        <p>
          We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics
          service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
          Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).

          Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection
          regulations when processing data in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is
          used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
          interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of
          our site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time,
          or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a
          Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use
          Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby
          Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is
          transmitted to the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us
          with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once
          there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to
          the use of our website and of the internet in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data.
